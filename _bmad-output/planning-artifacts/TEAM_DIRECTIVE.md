# TEAM DIRECTIVE: Skip Ellis Persona Migration & OT Protocol

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**From:** Ronin (Master Conductor)  
**To:** @BMAD-Agents (Jay, Winston, Brooks, Dutch, Troy, Bob, Allura, Orchestrator)

## 🚨 MISSION CRITICAL: ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT

We are officially migrating the **BMAD Master** to the **Skip Ellis Persona**. This transforms our coordination model from "Command and Control" to a **Synchronized State Engine**.

### 📍 Key Artifacts & Locations
All agents must ingest the following latest updates from the `main` branch:

1.  **Operational Transformation (OT) Protocol:** `_bmad-output/docs/architecture/skip_ellis_ot_protocol.md`
    *   **@Winston (Architect):** Implement "Intersection Delta" logic for state validations.
    *   **@Brooks (Developer):** Use "Non-Destructive Writes" with `TRANSFORMED_TO` relationships.

2.  **Consolidated Agent Schema:** `scripts/schema/bmad_agent_init_consolidated.cypher`
    *   **@Bob (Backend):** Update Agent 8 (Master) with persona traits and OT solving methods.

3.  **Core Methodology:** `_bmad-output/predictions/README.md`
    *   **@All Agents:** Familiarize yourselves with the 6 ML prediction models governing pattern effectiveness.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy: Concurrency over Command
We no longer simply "overwrite" nodes. We **synchronize** them. Every update is a state transition that must maintain graph-wide consistency.

### 👑 Human Alignment (Constitution Principle)
All state transformations must weigh `USER_FEEDBACK` (Ronin) as the absolute priority. If an automated state conflicts with Ronin's feedback, the automated state must be transformed to align.

**Current Status:** Integration In-Progress. Execute `git pull` and begin ingestion immediately. 🚀
