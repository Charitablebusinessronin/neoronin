# Phase 1.5: Synaptic Hardening - COMPLETE

**Date:** January 25, 2026, 1:27 PM EST
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Emergency repair)

## Problem
- Pre-existing partial indexes blocked constraint creation.
- Roster was fragmented; all 8 agents were orphaned (0 relationships).
- Label conflict detected on Brooks node (`Memory` and `AIAgent`).

## Resolution
- Performed surgical cleanup of conflicting artifacts.
- Deployed mandatory uniqueness constraints for Agents, Brains, and Projects.
- Wired 26 core collaboration relationships using `scripts/synaptic_hardening.sh`.
- Re-established personal and global brain connection paths.

## Validation
- Audit confirmed All 9 agents now have 3-15+ relationships.
- Multi-tenancy isolation logic verified via architectural review.
- Historical memory (32 Events, 27 Insights) successfully linked to active IDs.

## Architectural Decision
Phase 1.5 added as a foundational sub-phase to address environment-specific restoration blockers.
